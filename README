LED MATRIX DISPLAY
--------------------
For Programming the Led Matrix Display with the HT1632 Microcontroller we have used the following library found on GitHub, we thank Gauravmm for sharing his code, it is an excellent library.

STRING LIBRARY
--------------------
We do not use the processing string library for managing string of characters. This is due to some bugs when reusing strings in Arduino v0022.
Therefore we use the C language string approach, only fixed string/static size are allocated along the code, we do not use dynamic pointers. It words perfectly, no memory leakage at all.
